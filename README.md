#### Instructions

- All the functionalities should be implemented using functions.
- Test the functionality using assertions.
- Use proper names for variables and functions.
- Use comments to document the code.
- Format the code such that it is easily readable.
- Use gcc compiler (BIG NO to Turbo C)
- You are free to choose any editor. Recommended is codeblocks/ sublime/ Vi/ gedit/ Nano
- Create a GitHub account and upload all your practice problems under the folder C practice problems.
- Use MS Teams to discuss the issue with the faculty.

  1. Enter a 5 digit number and find the sum of its digits. For E.g. if int number = 12345; 
then sum = 15;
2. Write a program to reverse the number. For E.g. If int number = 12345; then the 
output reverse = 54321;
3. Write a program to count the occurrences of digit in a number.
4. WAP to check if a given number is a palindrome. For e.g. 12321, 56788765;
5. Generate the first 'N' prime numbers. For Eg. If N=5 then 2,3,5,7,11
6. Write a C program to display and find the sum of the series 1+11+111+....111 up to n.
For eg. if n=4, the series is: 1+11+111+1111. Take the value of 'n' as input from the 
user
7. A number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the cubes of the digits of the 
number is equal to the number. For example 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3. Write a C 
program that asks the user to enter a number and returns if it is Armstrong or not.
8. Amicable numbers are found in pairs. A given pair of numbers is Amicable if the sum 
of the proper divisors (not including itself) of one number is equal to the other number 
and vice â€“ versa. 
For example 220 & 284 are amicable numbers. First we find the proper divisors of   
220: 
220:1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110; 1+ 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284  
Now, 284: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142; 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220  
  Write a C program to check that the input pair of numbers is amicable
9. Write a menu driven program to read two integers & find their sum, difference & 
product
10. Write a C program to calculate the volume of the following shapes: Cube, Cuboid, 
Sphere, Cylinder and Cone. Ask the user which one s/he wants to calculate, and take 
the appropriate required inputs. Then print the result. The input should be taken in the 
main function and calculations for every solid should be done in a separate function 
by passing appropriate arguments.  
Example: If the user chooses the option for cube, only one input is required i.e., the 
side. The volume is then calculated and printed. 
If the user chooses the option for cuboid, only three inputs are required i.e., length, 
breadth and height. The volume is then calculated and printed.
11. An Electricity board charges the following rates for use of electricity.  
For the First 200 units : Rs 1 per unit   
For the next 100 units : Rs 1.5 per unit   
Beyond 300 units : Rs 2 Per unit.   
Write a C Program to read no of unit consumed and print out total charge 
amount
